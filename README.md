# Smart-pesiticide-sprayer
this uses an over the internet communication using third party applications like Blynk

This is a prototype model used to reduce human efforts and maximize the production of crops
this can be also used as a sanitizer sanitizer sprayer in hospitals too and various applications too

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

comming for the project part itself 
connections are to be made as per the circuit diagram as attached
the project requires three modules

1) MAIN MODULE which is responsible for the movement and stuffs 
    the main module is attached with 2 motors for movement 2 servos for pan and tilt of the sprayer and one for the panning of the camera
    the connection diagram is attached. this has a DC pump for the pumping of water
    
2) SUB MODULE or SENSOR MODULE
    the sensor module is that which all the sensors are attached to !
    the sensors include Temperature and humidity, soil moisture,and ultrasonic sensor for the forthcomming obstacle detection
    
 3) CAM MODULE 
    this module is responsible for the live footage delivery from the Rover
    
    these all modules are connected individually as a standalone modules to the wifi and thus transmitting and receiving the Data from and to the rover and the server
